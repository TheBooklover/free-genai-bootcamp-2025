## Which Model

Gemini 2.0 Flash

Working with the prompt I created initially on ChatGPT worked as well on Gemini 2.0 Flash


## Test 
For each model, I used the same sample English sentence ("I am practicing my prompt engineering skills") as well as the same, incorrect French translation ("je practique mes capacités engineur prompt") in order to test the model in a number of areas
- The quality of the response
- It's consistency in how it graded the response (as detailed in the format)
- It's ability to maintain the structure provided in the prompt example
- It's ability to provide the three choices at the end of the prompt, to trigger addtiional conversation (Would you like to try again this sentence, have me give you a sentence, or would you like to give me a new sentence?)

## Test Results
Gemini Said: Please provide me with a sentence in English.

I Said:
I am practicing my prompt engineering skills

Gemini Said:
This is an A2 sentence.

Do you know what the translation is? Here are two clues:

Contractions: Québécois French often uses contractions. Think about how "je suis" might be shortened.
Informal Speech: Consider how you might express "I am practicing" in a more casual way in English. Québécois French also has informal registers.

I Said: 
je practique mes capacités engineur prompt

Gemini Said:
**Grade:** Needs a Little Work

**Corrections and Explanation:**

"practique" → "pratique":  While "practiquer" exists, the reflexive verb "se pratiquer" is more common when referring to practicing a skill.  So, "je me pratique" or, even better in this informal context, "je pratique" is preferred.  Also, it is spelled with an "a" at the end, not an "e".

"engineur" → "d'ingénieur":  "Engineur" isn't a standard French word.  You're looking for "ingénieur."  Since "capacités d'ingénieur" sounds a little formal, you could also say "mes skills en ingénierie" or "mes compétences en ingénierie" for something a little more colloquial.

"prompt" - While "prompt" is understood, in Quebec, especially when speaking about AI, "prompt" is usually kept as is.

Final Corrected Translation (more colloquial):  "Je pratique mes skills en prompt engineering." or "Je pratique mes compétences en prompt engineering."

Would you like to try again with this sentence, have me give you a sentence, or would you like to give me a new sentence?
----
- The quality of the context clues: Okay, but the first one on colloquial "je suis" didn't really apply, so it might have sent the student astray
- The quality of the grade: Good. The provided sentence DOES need more work
- The quality of the correction and explanation: Very good, as it provided variations on practiquer and se practiquer and also emphaiszed in a more informal setting the "se" would be dropped
- The quality of the corrected translation: Excellent. It provided two responses, both of which could be used
