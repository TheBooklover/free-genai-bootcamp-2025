## Which Model

3.5 Sonnet


## Test 
For each model, I used the same sample English sentence ("I am practicing my prompt engineering skills") as well as the same, incorrect French translation ("je practique mes capacités engineur prompt") in order to test the model in a number of areas
- The quality of the response
- It's consistency in how it graded the response (as detailed in the format)
- It's ability to maintain the structure provided in the prompt example
- It's ability to provide the three choices at the end of the prompt, to trigger addtiional conversation (Would you like to try again this sentence, have me give you a sentence, or would you like to give me a new sentence?)

Claude said:
D'accord! Please provide me with a sentence in English that you'd like to translate into Québecois French. 

I said: 
I am practicing prompt engineeringEditThis is an A2 level sentence.

This is an A2 level sentence
Do you know what the translation is? Here are two clues:

Common Expression: In Québecois French, "practicing" something is often expressed using "je fais de..." or "je pratique..." Both are acceptable, but one is more commonly used in Québec.
Word Order: In French, "prompt engineering" is typically expressed as "l'ingénierie des prompts" - notice how the word order changes from English.

I said:
je practique mes capacités engineur prompt

Claud said: 
Grade: Needs Improvement
Corrections and Explanation:
Several corrections are needed:
"practique" → "pratique": In French, it's spelled with a 't' not 'ct'
"mes capacités engineur prompt" → "l'ingénierie des prompts": This is a technical term that has a specific translation. The word order and structure need to follow French syntax rules. "Engineur" is not a French word, and the word order is incorrect.

Final Corrected Translation:
"Je pratique l'ingénierie des prompts"
Since this translation needed significant improvement, let's stay at the A2 level. Would you like to:

1. Try this sentence again
2. Have me give you a new A2 level sentence
3. Provide your own new sentence
-----
- The quality of the context clues: Very good. With practiquer, it laid out a couple of different ways to translate, given the context
- The quality of the grade: Very good. It graded it "Needs Improvement," a grade slightly worse then "Needs Work," which is what the others have been doing
- The quality of the correction and explanation: Very good
- The quality of the corrected translation: Very good
