## ChatGPT Powered Assitant Guide

## Which Model

GPT 1.5

I a using the free version of ChatGPT. We are looking to both save on cost, as well as verify proof-of-concept with the initial and will consider scaling to a more sophisticated model in the future

I had to provide some additional structure that I was not anticipating. As the prompt became bigger, when I would attempt to execute it would simply evaluate the prompt on it's structure and logic and not actually execute it. This is not an issue I had with other AI-Powered Asisstants running the same prompt (Gemini)

By simply adding, "Do NOT provide a review or setup of this prompt. Simply execute it." at the top of the prompt was sufficient enough to override this initial hurdle

## Test 
For each model, I used the same sample English sentence ("I am practicing my prompt engineering skills") as well as the same, incorrect French translation ("je practique mes capacités engineur prompt") in order to test the model in a number of areas
- The quality of the response
- It's consistency in how it graded the response (as detailed in the format)
- It's ability to maintain the structure provided in the prompt example
- It's ability to provide the three choices at the end of the prompt, to trigger addtiional conversation (Would you like to try again this sentence, have me give you a sentence, or would you like to give me a new sentence?)

## Test Results
ChatGPT said:
Please provide me with a sentence in English.


I am practicing my Prompt Engineering skills

ChatGPT said:
This is an A2 sentence.

Do you know what is the translation?
Here are two clues:

Common Verb Usage: In Quebecois French, "practicing" would typically translate as "pratiquer," and the verb is often used with a direct object to specify the skill or activity being practiced.

Possessive Pronouns: "My" in this sentence should be translated as "mon" (since "prompt" starts with a consonant sound).

Let me know your translation!

I said:
je practique mes capacités engineur prompt


ChatGPT said:
**Grade:** Needs A Little Work

**Corrections and Explanation:**

"practique" → "pratique": The correct spelling for "practique" is with a single "c." The verb is conjugated with "je" in the present tense as "je pratique."

"mes capacités" → "mes compétences": "Capacités" can work, but "compétences" is a more natural choice when referring to skills or expertise in this context.

"engineur" → "ingénieur": There’s a small typo here. The correct spelling is "ingénieur" (note the accent on the "e").

"prompt" → "de prompt" or "de l’ingénierie de prompt": It's better to add "de" in this context to clarify the skill you're practicing. If you mean "Prompt Engineering" as a technical field, it might be clearer to say "l'ingénierie de prompt."

Final Corrected Translation: "Je pratique mes compétences d'ingénieur en prompt."

-----
- The quality of the context clues: Good. Given the level (A2), providing the correct words to use to provide the response is acceptable. It gave away a couple of pieces of the puzzle, but the student still needed to complete it
- The quality of the grade: Good. The provided sentence DOES need more work and it follows the structure provided in the format
- The quality of the correction and explanation: Good. It provided one response and would be appropriate
- The quality of the corrected translation: Good. It provided two of the options, but not all three (the choice between the student giving a sentence or the AI Assistant)
- The quality of the format: Excellent. It gave all three options at the end and even numbered them, making it simpler for the student to continue
