## Technical Uncertainty

**1.  How well can an AI-Powered Assistant perform a very broad task?** 
- It is okay, but our research has found that it is best served in executing specific, or very specific, tasks that is narrowly formatted by the designer to ensure it's response/action is consistent and repeatable. 

**2. Would a very broad task be better performed by dividing it into subtasks with specialized agents?** 
- Absolutely, in our research we found it is best to think through (perhaps even with the help of the AI) each of the steps in a particular task or flow or process and dedicate each step as a separate propmpt or action with the specialized agent

**3. Does using an AI-Powered Assistant make for a good place to rapidly prototype agents?**  
**4. How could we take the agent we built in an AI-Powered Assistant and reimplement it into a stack that allows for direct integration into our platform?** 
**5. How much do we have to rework our prompt documents from one AI-Powered Assistant to another?**  
**6. What prompting techniques can we naturally discover working in the confines of an AI-Powered Assistant?**  
**7. Are there any interesting innovations unique to specific AI-Powered Assistants for our business goal?**  
**8. What were we able to achieve based on our AI-Powered Assistant choice and our hardware, or budget limitations?**  
**9. What are the trade-offs between using a general AI-Powered Assistant versus fine-tuning a specialized model for our specific needs?**  
**10. **How does an AI-Powered Assistant’s API flexibility affect its ability to integrate into our existing workflows and automation systems?**  
**11. **What risks or limitations arise when relying on a single AI-Powered Assistant versus a multi-model approach?**  
**12. How do AI-Powered Assistants compare in terms of transparency, explainability, and debugging capabilities when troubleshooting outputs?**
