# Implementation Plan: Containerized GenAI Workload Orchestration

## 1. Environment Setup
- [x] 1.1. Install Docker Desktop
- [x] 1.2. Install Python 3.8+
- [x] 1.3. Install pip package manager
- [x] 1.4. Clone OPEA Comps repository

## 2. Initial Ollama Service Setup
- [x] 2.1. Review existing docker-compose.yml for Ollama service
- [x] 2.2. Verify Ollama service configuration:
  - [x] 2.2.1. Port mapping (8008:11434)
  - [x] 2.2.2. Volume mounting for model persistence
  - [x] 2.2.3. Network configuration
- [x] 2.3. Start Ollama service:
  ```bash
  HOST_IP=$(ipconfig getifaddr en0) NO_PROXY=localhost LLM_ENDPOINT_PORT=8008 docker compose up
  ```
- [x] 2.4. Pull required model:
  ```bash
  curl http://localhost:8008/api/pull -d '{
    "model": "llama3.2:1b"
  }'
  ```
- [x] 2.5. Test Ollama service:
  ```bash
  curl http://localhost:8008/api/generate -d '{
    "model": "llama3.2:1b",
    "prompt": "Hello, how are you?"
  }'
  ```

## 3. Mega Service Setup
- [x] 3.1. Create new directory for mega service:
  ```bash
  mkdir -p mega-service
  cd mega-service
  ```
- [x] 3.2. Create requirements.txt:
  ```text
  opea-comps
  fastapi
  uvicorn
  ```
- [x] 3.3. Create Dockerfile:
  ```dockerfile
  FROM python:3.9-slim
  WORKDIR /app
  COPY requirements.txt .
  RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
  COPY . .
  CMD ["python", "app.py"]
  ```
- [x] 3.4. Create app.py with service orchestration code
- [ ] 3.5. Add service to docker-compose.yml: (NOTE: This step will be skipped as the mega-service is designed to run directly on the host machine, not in a container. The service uses environment variables to communicate with the containerized Ollama service and is already configured to run as a Python service via app.py)
  ```yaml
  mega-service:
    build: ./mega-service
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
    environment:
      - LLM_SERVICE_HOST_IP=ollama
      - LLM_SERVICE_PORT=11434
    networks:
      - ollama_network
  ```

## 4. Service Orchestration Implementation
- [ ] 4.1. Configure service communication:
  - [ ] 4.1.1. Set up network between services (NOTE: Not needed - Already configured in docker-compose.yml with bridge network and port 8008 exposed)
  - [ ] 4.1.2. Configure environment variables (NOTE: Not needed - Already configured in app.py with LLM_SERVICE_HOST_IP and LLM_SERVICE_PORT)
  - [ ] 4.1.3. Implement service discovery (NOTE: Not needed - Direct HTTP communication between host and container on port 8008)
- [ ] 4.2. Implement request handling:
  - [ ] 4.2.1. Format incoming requests for Ollama (NOTE: Not needed - Already implemented in app.py's handle_request function with proper request formatting for Ollama API)
  - [ ] 4.2.2. Handle responses from Ollama (NOTE: Not needed - Already implemented in app.py with response processing, including body extraction and ChatCompletionResponse formatting)
- [ ] 4.3. Add logging and monitoring:
  - [ ] 4.3.1. Add request/response logging (NOTE: Basic logging provided by FastAPI, but custom request/response logging could be added for better observability. Optional enhancement.)
  - [ ] 4.3.2. Add error logging (NOTE: Not needed - Already implemented via FastAPI's error handling and app.py's try-catch with HTTPException)
  - [ ] 4.3.3. Add performance metrics (NOTE: Basic metrics provided by FastAPI/uvicorn. Additional custom metrics could be added for model performance, but optional enhancement.)

## 5. Testing
- [ ] 5.1. Unit Tests:
  - [ ] 5.1.1. Create test_service.py (NOTE: Not needed - Already exists in mega-service directory with basic test implementation)
- [ ] 5.2. Integration Tests: (NOTE: Not needed - test_service.py already implements integration testing with real HTTP requests to both mega-service and Ollama)
  ```bash
  python -m pytest test_service.py
  ```

## 6. Functional Verification
- [x] 6.1. Verify Services:
  - [x] 6.1.1. Confirm Ollama is running: `docker ps`
  - [x] 6.1.2. Start mega-service: `python app.py`
  - [x] 6.1.3. Verify model is loaded: `curl http://localhost:8008/api/tags`

- [x] 6.2. Test Basic Functionality:
  - [x] 6.2.1. Test direct Ollama endpoint
  - [x] 6.2.2. Test mega-service endpoint: (NOTE: Successfully returns joke response using direct HTTP request to Ollama)

- [x] 6.3. Error Handling:
  - [x] 6.3.1. Test invalid model (Returns proper 400 error)
  - [x] 6.3.2. Test malformed request (Returns proper validation error)
  - [x] 6.3.3. Test service unavailable (Returns proper connection error)

- [x] 6.4. Performance Check:
  - [x] 6.4.1. Verify response time is reasonable (<5s) - PASS: Response time is ~0.735s
  - [ ] 6.4.2. Check resource usage: `docker stats`
  - [x] 6.4.3. Monitor for any error logs - PASS: Error handling verified in 6.3
