# Missing API Endpoints Analysis

## Overview
Based on comparing frontend API calls with existing backend routes, here are the missing endpoints that need to be implemented.

## Words API Endpoints
For managing vocabulary words and their associated data:

- [x] `GET /words` - For fetching paginated words list
  - Paginated list of all words
  - Supports sorting and filtering
  - Returns word details and metadata
- [x] `GET /words/{wordId}` - For fetching word details

## Groups API Endpoints
For handling word groupings and collections:

- [x] `GET /groups` - For fetching paginated groups
  - Paginated list of all groups
  - Supports sorting by name, word_count, created_at
  - Returns group details and metadata
- [ ] `GET /groups/{groupId}` - For fetching group details
- [ ] `GET /groups/{groupId}/words` - For fetching words in a group
- [ ] `GET /groups/{groupId}/study_sessions` - For fetching group study sessions

## Study Sessions API Endpoints
For managing learning sessions and progress tracking:

- [ ] `GET /study_sessions` - For fetching paginated study sessions
- [ ] `GET /study_sessions/{sessionId}` - For fetching session details
- [ ] `POST /study_sessions/{sessionId}/review` - For submitting session reviews

## Dashboard API Endpoints
For displaying user progress and statistics:

- [ ] `GET /dashboard/recent-session` - For fetching recent study session
- [ ] `GET /dashboard/stats` - For fetching study statistics

## Priority Assessment
The most critical missing endpoints appear to be the Groups API endpoints (except for GET /groups which is now implemented) and the Study Sessions API endpoints, as they're core to the application's functionality.
Let me know if you would like implementations for any of these specific endpoints.
