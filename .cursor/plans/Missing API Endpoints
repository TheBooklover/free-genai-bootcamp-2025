# Missing API Endpoints Analysis

## Overview
Based on comparing frontend API calls with existing backend routes, here are the missing endpoints that need to be implemented.

## Words API Endpoints
For managing vocabulary words and their associated data:

- [x] `GET /words` - For fetching paginated words list
  - Paginated list of all words
  - Supports sorting and filtering
  - Returns word details and metadata
- [x] `GET /words/{wordId}` - For fetching word details

Note: Word management appears to be handled through pre-populated data rather than user creation.

## Groups API Endpoints
For handling word groupings and collections:

- [x] `GET /groups` - For fetching paginated groups
- [x] `GET /groups/{groupId}` - For fetching group details
- [x] `GET /groups/{groupId}/words` - For fetching words in a group
- [x] `GET /groups/{groupId}/study_sessions` - For fetching group study sessions
- [ ] `GET /groups/{groupId}/words/raw` - For getting raw word data

Note: Groups are pre-populated lesson sets rather than user-created collections. No CRUD operations needed.

## Study Sessions API Endpoints
For managing learning sessions and progress tracking:

- [x] `GET /study_sessions` - For fetching paginated study sessions
- [x] `GET /study_sessions/{sessionId}` - For fetching session details
- [x] `POST /study_sessions/{sessionId}/review` - For submitting session reviews
- [ ] `POST /study_sessions/reset` - For resetting study history

## Study Activities API Endpoints
- [x] `GET /study-activities` - For fetching all study activities
- [x] `GET /study-activities/{id}` - For fetching activity details
- [x] `GET /study-activities/{id}/sessions` - For fetching activity sessions

## Dashboard API Endpoints
For displaying user progress and statistics:

- [x] `GET /dashboard/recent-session` - For fetching recent study session
- [x] `GET /dashboard/stats` - For fetching study statistics

## Priority Assessment
The most critical missing endpoints appear to be:
1. Study Sessions management endpoints (PUT, DELETE)

These endpoints are essential for managing user study progress.
Let me know if you would like implementations for any of these specific endpoints.
