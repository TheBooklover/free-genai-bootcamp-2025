# OPEA Implementation Experience

## Initial Challenges
- Found difficulty following along with the ExamPro video tutorial
- Decided to take a more structured, methodical approach using AI assistance
- Used Cursor AI to break down the homework assignment into manageable steps

## Implementation Strategy
1. **Planning Phase**
   - Fed homework requirements into Cursor AI
   - Generated detailed implementation plan in markdown
   - Validated necessity of each step before proceeding
   - Created clear, testable milestones

2. **Setup Phase**
   - Established development environment
   - Installed required dependencies (Docker, Python)
   - Set up Ollama service in container
   - Created mega-service structure

3. **Development Phase**
   - Built service orchestration layer
   - Implemented request/response handling
   - Added error validation
   - Set up proper environment configuration

4. **Testing & Verification**
   - Verified basic functionality:
     - Direct Ollama communication
     - Request processing
     - Response formatting
   - Tested error scenarios:
     - Invalid models
     - Malformed requests
     - Service unavailability
   - Confirmed performance metrics

## Key Learnings
1. **Architecture Understanding**
   - Learned how microservices communicate
   - Understood containerization benefits
   - Grasped service orchestration concepts

2. **Technical Skills**
   - Docker container management
   - Python service development
   - API integration
   - Error handling
   - Performance testing

3. **Process Improvements**
   - Breaking down complex tasks
   - Systematic testing
   - Documentation importance
   - Error scenario handling

## Results
- Successfully implemented working OPEA service
- Achieved proper integration with Ollama
- Demonstrated error resilience
- Met performance requirements (~0.735s response time)
- Gained practical microservices experience

## Conclusion
The implementation process, while initially challenging, became manageable through a structured approach. Using AI assistance to break down the task and validate steps helped ensure thorough understanding and successful completion. The final result is a robust service that properly handles requests, manages errors, and delivers expected performance.
